Reflection on Website Development Process

This project pushed me to enhance my debugging and problem-solving skills in web development. I spent a lot of time resolving styling inconsistencies, particularly with dark mode. Questions like, "Why isn't this element's color refreshing?" and "How can I make these styles function correctly in dark mode?" compelled me to learn about CSS specificity and selector behavior with care. I also wrestled with layout, constantly asking myself, "How do I achieve consistent spacing here?" and "Why is this item overflowing its container?". This actually served to cement my understanding of the CSS box model and responsive design principles, which is crucial to producing websites that will work across different devices.

Making it more accessible was about wrestling with how skip links are set up. I remember wondering, "Why isn't this skip link working?" and "How do I get it properly visible and functional for keyboard users?". This required a concerted effort to master CSS positioning, transform properties, and focus states, confirming the worth of inclusive design. Finally, optimizing the profile picture brought another set of questions: "How do I reduce the file size without sacrificing too much on the quality?" and "What are the optimal image sizes to show on the web?". These were the issues that highlighted the importance of image optimization techniques in page performance and scalability.

Beyond the technical hurdles, it was genuinely rewarding to build a website that feels practical and scalable. Knowing that this project can serve as my own portfolio, a place to showcase my skills and projects effectively, adds a significant layer of value to the entire process. The focus on responsive design and accessibility also ensures that the site can reach a wider audience and remain relevant as technology evolves.
